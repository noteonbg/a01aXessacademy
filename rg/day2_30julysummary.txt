1. show your loyalty towards project and not technology.. respect architecture
first...
2. http... only then web is there..
3. http..
request
response...
4. request and you get a web page... that means your boss is the browser.
5. challenges are knowing your zoom outs.. which browser, which devices
what resolution.....
6. html.. structure of the page.... semantic tags, main, nav, aside.. section..
form related tags...
7. in terms of "what I should do as a participant"
write some code.
understand other person code.
8. basics will keep on killing us, what to do we have to live with it.
example when we have a html page, good zoom point is to know which part
changes, which part does not change..
9. read from official sources and then come to the freaky place
mdn is the place for web...


page no 9...
1. semantic html web page...
what is reality...
you cannot make any html look decent without using CSS.
css.. what does it do. it does "decoration" for the page...

I am good at everything... is this a great statement or a stpuid statmenet
real life means unequal effort..

what is reality
we should be good at our thing and know a little bit altest about other 
thigns... doing this is called as 
"respecting the system" we should good at we do and know what other entities
do little bit atleast.


CSS is pacific ocean.. our job is to drink two spoons of water and feel happy
about it...

what is hard thing about CSS ... is making the layouts of the page...

concept is not a function of time
syntax is..

quick summary

1. css is used to decorate
2. you can have different kind of decorations depending on devices, screens.
3. syntax is selector, what decoration
4. where to write it.
at the element level
at the html file level.
separately and link to different files..
5. css box what goes into the properties.
5. display property key... to making good layouts.





slide no 35... a01basic.html...

standard myth problem... I want practicals and no theory
unlimited misery will come because of this...
science it means getting theory right...

I can keep doing practicals for 300 years and be zero in the subject..
respect theory...


what to do now.

1. open the pdf.. look at css content.
2. \a01aXessacademy\rg\a03css\sampleprograms
look at the programs.
3. page 9. try to think how the semantic web page...
a01semenaticweb.html  -- priority
a02sementicweb.html -- CSS to it...needs lot of exploration...

so in terms of assignments.


high priority
0. ensure you go thru the pdf. without fail....
1. form assignment of the pdf .. page..30
2. html, css assignment of page 9 of the pdf.
2.1 one file only with html. without any CSS.
2.2 two files or one file with html and css.

moderate priority
3. problemstatement.txt file present in the 
a01aXessacademy\rg\a03css\sampleprograms folder.
4. a01html-handbook.pdf present in a01aXessacademy\rg\a02html\sampleprograms
folder.













BootStrap...
what is it...  everything involves selling.. so as  technical person
stay away from the sales pitch and see what does it offer technically
to you...

Bootstrap is a css library... we instead of writing our own css which
we have to write... here we get ready made makeupset.. which we can consider
using...


selector

what is fundamental difference

p { some makeup }
#x  { some makeup }
.pqr { some makeup }

in this interesting this class selector why... 

1. it does not get applied automatically you must apply the class.

<p class="pqr"

I am bootstrap most of times means we are going to use classes of the boot
strap library...

if you have a feature X in language 
if you have a feature X given by the framework, which you should prefer
usually means... prefer X in the language so that you can cut down
dependency on an external thing..

bootstrap is a css library...for all practical purposes..
using boot strap means using classes of bootstrap
what is  benefit we get.

device independence
more stylish makeup if you ok... English...

in todays world you got lot of options..
tailwind

what is moral. doing zoom in, without zoom out will guarantee misery....


we are in web technology..
everything has to get downloaded from server.. browser..
if you are referring to something from a cdn.
there are many sites which will using the same, hence possibility
of file present in our system itself earlier is high..

to use bootstrap...

1. include the css file
2. include the javascript files given by the bootstrap guys..
what are those files.. we can learn it as when it needed..

using bootstrap means using bootstrap classes for our element...



anything we write only our code and not look other people code
our understanding will be poor.

if it is not a fact , it must be a OPINION

science person should be scared about opinions being potrayed as facts..
bootstrap is an opinion..
tailwind is another opionion..
so dont hang on .. as a "fan" of anything..

inside the html page, i would have used classes of bootstrap


bootstrap
1. screens according to devices, you get css classes which can you consider to use
2. we columns ...
3. what kind of tags... you get tags to format tables..
4.


moral of the story.
1. bootstrap is ajust a css framework.
2. why we should use it.. device independence and hopefully better decoration..
3. using bootstrap means using classes of bootstrap.
4. bootstrap categorize your tags in to layout tags... layout...
various of forms, buttons, table related tags...

bootstrap..
do the following
1.read the pdf.
2. bootstrap folder you got sample programs
3. understand it...	document each class what it does..
<!--  -->
/*  */
4. if interested remove one class and see what is effect, then add the class.
