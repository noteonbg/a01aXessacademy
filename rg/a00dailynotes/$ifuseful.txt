having things in the mind.. mental hospitall.
written format... planning.


0. show good intent..
1. are you clear about the requirements.. 
2. how your screens will look like.. (long way to go)
3. what all activities the team has to do, in what order.., who will do
it should be the last
4. git strategy.... is entire team clear, who is responsible repository
management.. chief ambulance officer..
5. a react project which the entire team uses... which is proven
to work .. with all the features.. that project needs to ensue
it has got the correct thing in package.json... random updates..
on the project npm update.. will  kill yourself..
6. focus on must have requirements first and ensure it is done..
good to have.. come in the second iteration..
7. it cant be without css... so what is your approach with respect
to bootstrap and css with the whole project...

-------------------------------------------------------------
for each component in REact we must know the below things before coding..



1. we have ui... component.
2. component , changing things and non changing things.
props, state. any default values..
3. components can be nested. so they need to communicate.
how the will communicate.
4. validation needed
4.event handling will be there.. so what all events you
want to react to.. and what they are expected to do.
5. navigating thru the components.. .. routing...
details..
6. when all you want to contact server... 
6.1 what is purpose.
6.2 what will you send.****
6.3 what will you get.****
6.4 when failure happens 
	what will you do if failure because of user.
	what will you do if failure is because of system.. server..
6.5 when success happens what will you do
6.6 mode of http request.. get, post, put or delete.

look at these examples..

1. project name.
a03listformcommu-app
<Rectpoc/>
<SideEffect/> -- using fetch.. change it to axios
<ResourceManagerComponentWithAxios/> 

2. you have have to do your assingments aim for completion
and then again go thru the checklist..

---------------------------------------------------

1. use ar react project.
put all depenancies in it..

1. bootstrap
2. routing.
3. axios.

just show one routing program is working there..
one axios program is working.. in poc..

and push this project into a branch called "pocproject"
shoud be able to clone this branch and then create a new branch
and prove that project created by person is working in your system.
---------------------------

by monday  ie 11th August 2025.
1. in youir project repo there will be branch called project poc.
which will have react project where routing and axios small example is working.
2. you are clear about what you will do in git...
