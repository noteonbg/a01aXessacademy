Git ..

what all things we have to do in
what order.
this must be in written format..
and then comes who will do it..

Gannt chart..

Git...

why...
without git you will not be control the changes..
what does that mean for my project..

azure repo.
1. branch 
ui
api
develop
feature.
nobody has business changing feature or develop
branch except the person who is controlling the repo.

local system.
day 1
clone the repo. (folder) keep it fixed..
checkout the feature branch..
create a new branch called login.... based on feature..add all your code to this
add files
commit.
push the branch to the repo
pull request..
what is thing... team should review code is ok
or not okk.. if ok.. loginfeature branch
ill be merged with the feature branch...
delete your login-branch...

day 2..
get the files from repo...
come to your branch feature.. branch..






what all git command we need to work...

-------------------------------------------
check all the settings.
System-level settings
git config --system --list

User level settings
git config --global --list

Project specific repository level, 
settings
first be inside the repository folder...

-----------------------------------------

for every command of yours in the company

git -c http.sslverify=false .. and then the command example

0. be conscious about the folder we are in
F:\bootcamp


1. clone 
git clone https://github.com/noteonbg/pocrepo.git

2. look at folder in windows explorer
or dir you must see your repo folder.
this will be your project folder
dont change it.. please...
come to your repo folder...
in my case 
F:\bootcamp\pocrepo

2. how to check which branches we got.
git branch -a
you will see remote as well as local
branches..


3. how to switch to a branch.
git checkout feature


4. how to create a new branch..
git checkout -b loginfeature

5. how to add files
5.1 files and folders are added, sample
echo "login feature added" >> login.html
git add .

6. how to commit.
git commit -m "login feature added"


7. how to push the new  branch to the repo.
git push -u origin loginfeature


8. how to do a pull request..
stop stop stop, look at the code just dont merge...
go to github and ensure .. you see pull request...
you will see the loginfeature branch, patiently select which branch you want to merge to.
give a pull request. review the code if merge successful delete the loginfeature branch.


9. how to delete our branch.
check out to the feature branch
git checkout feature
git branch -d loginfeature

10. how to ensure latest data from repo
is available in our system..
be in the feature branch
git pull origin feature    
look ltest files should be in the feature ...


----------------------------------------------------------
11. repeat 3, 4,5,6,7,9,...
example .. we are in the feature branch... our branch has data that is in the repo..

12. git checkout -b postloginfeature
echo "postlogin features added" >> postlogin.html


13. git add .

14 git commit  -m  "#taskid message commited"

15. push the postlogin branch to the remote repository.

16. now do a pull request.. and ... normal stuff..

17. ensure whichever branch you have , you have the same thing
present in the repository before you add things..


----------------------------------------

git fetch origin..
find out what this command does..


git fetch --prune
to ensure remote branches that no longer exist on remote..
use it frequently...
