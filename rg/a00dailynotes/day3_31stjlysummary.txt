what is Path.

Path is a variable used by the OS to locate executable files..
c:\goldenversion you are telling the os, hey look at these places when I give you a file to execute.

in system thinking.. we cannot be 5/5 in everything, but we should 5/5in something
and other parts we should try at least 1/5 and not zero.


quick summary.

0. intent first everything else last..

what should be our intent, to solve customer problem or improve our technical skills
at customer cost..

Explain history in computer science in one word....   Abstraction

amount of things you need to cook should reduce...

assembly and C .. abstraction
c and C++ abstraction
c++ and java abstraction
language and framework abstraction...

if use bootstrap, amount of cooking we need to do will reduce.. that means we can do things
faster for the customer... hence .. generalize.. framework is a way thru which we increase
the abstraction. so that we can focus on customers problems..


1. css , html does different roles..
2. selectors... tonnes of css properties, we may know we may know the properties
we have the ablity to learn it on need basis..
3. class selector in css.. that is key... why.. it does not get applied automatically
we have to apply it..
4. css box model.. margin padding...
5. most important thing.. display property.. layouts..
6. bootstrap library...it involves lot of classes 
classes can do layout  ( ...device responsiveness) , ui, classes can do table design..
7. javascript...
5/5 in functions and variables.

function
1. function definition
2. calling
3. assingment != calling..
we define a function, we assign it and somebody else will call it
== Event handling == Call backs..

variable
data type
scope.

I "know/no" the programming language...

1. documentation standard (1/5)
2. variable data type scope casting rules (5/5)
3. runtime time error handling and quantifying (5/5)
4. string handling and date handling (2/5)
5. using datastructures like linkedlist and dictionaries(2/5)
never take a person who tells I like datastructures seriously just laugh and go away..
6. how to use tools, ides, unit tesing, profiling, library usage ( 0.00001/5)


what to do..
1. go thru the javascript pdf 22 slides.
2. go thru the sample programs till  a06javascriptscope.html
3. observe ...
function calling
function definition
function assignment
4. problem statement given slide no 22.
5. in case you complete these go back to bootstrap sample programs and start
documenting what each class does... in comments. (this is boring but important please do this also)



quality of decision will always be measured by time factor you considered..

in any project.. in any program..

1. logic
2. display part.

common sense is always separate the presentation and logic. this is dinosaur stuff.

//logic part
function getfibonaccinumbers()
{
const Fibonacci =[];
..logic.
console.log
return fibonacci


}

kids favourite word .. one way of doing things.
in real life, things are non deterministic..


//ui  part
function printingfunction()
{
console.log(getfibonacci());


}


function get8table()
{


}

logic part and ui part separate in any programming language...



how do you know a function is complex function or a simple function?
count the number of conditions in the function... ensure it is around 3 or less than 3..

cyclomatic complexity...

moral of the story.
1. loyalty towards project respect architecture, it means dont mix logic and ui..presentation.
2. in terms of our assingments.

one function which returns... the Fibonacci numbers
one function which returns the multiplication string or objects..
single console.log to print both

console.log(f1(), f2());




Array.
heterogenous , homogenous are all kids world terminologies no use in real life..
array has to be contiguous... and usually it has a fixed size, but in javascript array size is dynamic and it can grow..

let x=[];
let x =new Array();
why so many styles.. languages evolve.. they have to make new versions sometimes brain does not work only thing
left is add a new way of doing the old thing...

group of things called with the same name... and it is a linear datastructure, if you want to search
start from first element and reach till the last element..

with array what all things we should know..

1. how to create an array
2. how to add elements.
3. how to access each element of the array ( iterate thru the array)
4. how to search in the array
5. how to sort the array.
6. in case we are in a bad mood.
6.1 modify the element in the array
6.2 remove the element from the array

typically in real life (in a project).. what will an array contain most probably..
some objects..

what is most important thing needed for sorting?
comparing among the two elements which one is big, which one is small and whether are both are equal

when you use sort function in any programming alngauge open documentation and read it..









who is calling forEach .. 
x) we are calling or the 
y) owner of the forEach function is calling display


forEach is a ready made function provided with the array.
this foreach input argument must be a function which takes two input arguments and returns
nothing..
if you pass that function(x)  to forEach
what forEach will do, take each element from the array and its index, call your x function
by passing array element and index, what you do inside is your job... and not that for each..

1, fuction calling
2. function definition
3. function assignment.

function assignment you will see.

1. function calling of somebody else function
2. we define a function and pass it as an input argument to some other person function.
3. so we must know what some other function expects from our function.


whenever we write


f1(f2);
be 100% sure f1 we will not be the ownwer we will be caller.
f2 we will be owner and we will defining it and we will not call it.
how f2 will be defined will be known to use only if you open documentation of f1.

f1=filter, map, find, ....

let x ="HI";
x.toLowerCase();
console.log(x);

object real life data type...
which is not present in the language so we create it..

data type = content + operations
object == variables present in the object + functions present will be the operations.


Circle
{
int radius  --content
behavior
getRAdius operations
getPerimeter
getArea.



}


welcome to deaddiction center.. for what
get deaddicted from it, welcome to objects in real life...
int will  not do anything fo rus in real life, it is always objects 



if you tell I am calling. the function

f1();
---------------------------------------
what to do 
look at programs ... a07... to a09.. only in JavaScript don't go beyond..
and copy paste some programs on

these are super useful things in react so high priority
for-each
filter
find
map
do the page 31 assignment..

be conscious about
1. function calling
2. function definition
3. function assigning..

each person individual assignment will be checked start from today ... evening...
==================================================================================


1.  html assignment with you form validation.
2. css  page page 9
3. bootstrap page .. 58 html pdf.. keep it pending...
4. page  56 .. 59 keep the ui ready using bootstrap, this has to be bootstrap..



what do you mean event/
event means change in a variable value and somebody should be intimated about it.

better technical language.
event means change in state and somebody should be notified about it.

let i =3;
i =4;
//i value had 3 earlier now it is 4.. has i value changed, yes... is it an event no.
why after this change we did not notify anybody of this change... 


Event Source--X
1. change in state , change in variable value.
2. notification mechanism... to interested listeners..

Person interested in the Event ... EVent LIstener. --Y  --Most of times we are this..
1. it should register with the event source for the event..  ( define a function and assign it.... wait.. one day
when the event occurs the function will get called )
2. it should define a function..... this function will get called by Event source when the event occurs

so what do we do.
define a function and assign it and relax. one day .. event will occur then the function will get called.


define a function and assign a function means system will be calling the function under some circumstance.

anybody who tells we called the function,next question show me where in the code?


so moral of the story, entire event hanlding you will see assignment of functions..
that is we write a function we assign it.. then who is going to call it, one day event will occur
when it occurs event source will call our function...

Event typically are one way communication from Event Source to Event listener..
that means within event hanlding functions you wont see this word return "something"

"We are calling it.." .. you should show ..  f1(); without any quotes...











simple thing especially IT industry people...
expansion of something is not knowing the thing...

expand http.
HyperText Transfer protocol

what is http?
find out...




Dom and form manipulation
expand DOM.. Document Object Model
what is DOM.. memory representation of all elements of the html is called as DOM.

why we should know DOM only thru DOM knowing we can change sections of the html page
.. 
change.. read it or change it..

there are various objcts present in the browser.
one such object is called document which refers to the page which is being currently rendered.
this object has got lot of functions..


access sections of the html page.. and with whatever you get 
can 1. read it or change it..


<p title="mytitle" style="color:blue;backgroundcolor:green">changed paragraph values.. <p>
dynamically changing the html..

access the html page
change its content.
you cannot until you know how to do dom manipulation..
for doing dom manipulation you should be conscious about what element you are getting..
P, textbox, radiobutton, link...


symptoms of a fragile programmer
when variale name changes, his concept goes out of the window..


with javascript
1. validation
2. access parts of html page and change it... (see is this)


<p> </p>

<table>
<tr> <td> 1 </td> <td>2 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 1 </td> <td>2 </td> </tr>  //via javascript..

<table>


one important is to recognize style of coding, that is important different ways to code ..




event handling can be done in different styles..



let f1 =function()
{
console.log("freak");
}

f1();



<button> ok</button>

<input type="button" value="ok"/>


people who are busy writing their own code and dont look at other people code
can never learn any technology.

ratio 3:7
3 is my own code.
7 is other people code.



4:6

WHAT TO DO..

1. go thru the pdf till slide 42.
2. go thru programs... a10... to a15.... in JavaScript
3. then try the assignment in slide 42.
4. please go thru slides 56 to 59 and you have to make bootstrap pages for the same...
5. those who are comfortable can start page 58 in html,css, bootstrap.pdf using bootstrap..

assignment list.
1. html page form validation
2. html page CSS. 2 pages .. with an addition css file... if you made it.
3. boot strap home page. page 58 in html css.pdf
4. JavaScript assignments ...  2+1+2
5. bootstrap pages for the javascript assingments given in page 56 to 59 of javascript.pdf

I think it is better that on each assignment on the top
you write a comment.

1. which page no of  which pdf.
2. big comment what will you explain if they ask how you did it..
3. do write comments line by line what each line does without fail...
