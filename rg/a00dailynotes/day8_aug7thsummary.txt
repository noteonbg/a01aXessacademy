Event handling..


const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState(99.9); 

be conscious and observe, settemparature function
we have not defined anywhere.. who has defined it react...


if you are clear about event hanlding... then ..
all hooks are nothing but event hanlding..

useState...

1. my component becomes event source.. 
2. some variable is there which will change.
3. react framework will become a listener... it is telling I
am interested for the event... how.. it will tell you i have
defined a function, please call this..

2. in javascript... how knowing the language really matters..

common thing between stupid programmer and intelligent programmer.
both their programs work..

intelligent programmer can tell why it is working
stupid programmer will tell ok output came.. enjoy as long it 
is coming..


1. react component... can get dynamic things....
state and props.




any who who writes more than one components

must think of how communication takes place between components.


parent component and chld component.
child component and parent component
between two independent components..

virtual dom.. more of  a terminology...

1. reality, updating the ui is painful thing in real life..
and expensive thing.. it consumes time.
2. react does keep a virtual copy of the dom.. and it compares
virtual copy with real copy and sees are changes only
then it renders the component..

rendering the component.
putting the component in the dom tree to be visible..

if possible consider this approach for any technical thing.

1. tell what is concept dont tell the syntax
2. then tell the syntax.
3. give an example
4. if possible talk about best practices..

state .. something that can change inside the ocmonent.






let i =3;
i =5;

component has changed..
means

1. some props given has changed.
2. some state has changed..
that the component has to be showing the page again.

practical questions
checklist
1. can you write a non dynamic component and make it work.
2. do you how to use state for variables of basic type as well as object.
3. do you know how to use props.
4. do you know how to setup event handling.
5. are you ok with javascript... things.. most important
function assignment..


Remember any design ...
you get a + means you get a minus also...

React Hooks

REact hooks help us in making a functional component
as a event source for react..

Array destructuring is taking individual element of the array
and assigning to a variable.

let x =[2,3];
let [k,m]=x;


let k = x[0]
let m = x[1];


let x = () => setCount(count + 1);

<button onClick={x}>Click me</button>
we have button
we have registered for onClickevent
the function that gets called when onclickevent occurs
is anonymous function..





how did the parent function come to child..
thru props.
inside the child call the parents function..


PatientManager and Patientcard should show you how
parent communicates to child
child communicates to parent..

favourite word of students .. "Inbuilt" system given...
all these things needs details.

11.03AM ... 11.18AM...
...

when we see function assignment dont try to understand the
function just ignore and keep going , why functon ssingment
is to equivalent to calling..

only when you see function calling try to understand the code.

you have to move the value from the textbox value to the
state variable value...

all of you should practice.. how to use textboxes in react..

<Form action="" method="get">

<input type="submit" value="ok submit now">
</form>


1. rg\a08react01basic\a03listformcommu-app

folders present in src
componentcommunication
validation
createViewall

go thru these things and get assignment working..
pg 42 of the pdf..


web http..
we need both server and client..
server...
process the request and send the response...

html page/css/(js).. is processed by web server or the browser..

web archtcture..
client server...

web designer...
web programmer.

var i
let k
const j


let i;
console.log(i);


let i  ={ length:3, breadth:4 };
console.log(i.length=5)

what all things do we do in javascript

1. access sections of the page and change it.. or access it
document.getElementById, document.queryselector, 
2. validation 
3. contact server and send some data .. fetch


this... 

this in javascript has got different meaning you can never
answer it.. until you know where you have used it..

this...
class A
{
f1()
{//you are insie f1.. how will youi know x called o ry called
there will something called this...
	
}

}

let x =new A();
let y =new A();
x.f1();
y.f1();

how do you concatenate strings in javaascript poor mans way..
"Hello" + "hi";

m1.filter(f1);

what is m1... array.
it will each element from the array and call f1...
foreach
map...
what it does end is totally..
foreach
filter
map

you take each element from the array, and decide to what to do with it.

class Rect
{

constructor() {  this.length=3; this.breadth=4}
setlength(x) { this.length=x;  }
getarea() { return this.length*this.breadth }

}

html
1.inline and block elements..
2. css..selector..     { color:green }

css
write at head level.. so page specific elements
write at element inline .. so element specific css. only for that
write a separate file .. so that across pages you can use css..
 

grid system... 12
layouts... vertical, inline, horizontal..

let x=2;
console.log(typeof x)


what to do.
1. would prefer you to work on the react assignment...
step by step... and understand the code.. while writing.
2. prepare for the exam if you feel that is needed.

remaining part of the day a schedule..
3.  3.45 PM .. git strategy.. we will discuss.
4. project discussion with individual teams
1. credit card origination.
2. loan origination
3. payment initialization.
4. Rw tool.
